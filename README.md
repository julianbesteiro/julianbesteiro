 <summary><h3>My Working Journey</h3></summary>
<p>I have a background in Business Administration and initially built my career in Finance, where I reached senior analyst roles within Budgeting & Controlling and Planning & Reporting teams. Over the course of 5+ years, I really sharpened my analytical, reporting, and accounting skills in a corporate setting.</p>

<p>Driven by my curiosity for e-commerce, I started studying digital marketing and eventually transitioned into a data-driven media buyer specialized in Facebook/Instagram Ads. Collaborating with companies in the U.S. and France, I profitably managed social media ads budgets in different industries, reaching a personal record level of EUR 1.5M ad spend in a 4-month period during 2021 H2.</p>

<p>Throughout my e-commerce experience, I evolved into an e-com strategist after having developed strong expertise in paid media, email & SMS marketing, website conversion rate optimization, offer creation, and funnel optimization. Additionally, I gained valuable skills in presenting strategies and performance results to clients, as well as managing projects.</p>

<p>Seeking to broaden my skill set, I completed a 100-hour Javascript fundamentals course, discovering a passion for coding along the way. Motivated by it, I enrolled in a rigorous 4-month full-time Coding Bootcamp focused on full-stack web development with Javascript. With over 800 hours of intensive training and the completion of three professional projects, I have emerged as a dedicated developer eager to tackle new projects and embrace new technologies.</p>
